Records (also called tuples or structs) are among the simplest data structures. A record is a value that contains other values, typically in fixed number and sequence and typically indexed by names. The elements of records are usually called fields or members.

Put aside the actual implementation and think about the purpose.

Essence of Records:

* A unit bundling some simpler data types together
* Accessible by index or name.

In 2D arrays, you can think of the first dimension as the original Array of elements
and second dimension as the properties of each element.

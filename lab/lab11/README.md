So far, we have learnt Java bits, OOP concepts, and programming
methodologies, but we haven't got into the meat of data structures
yet. We have only dealt with Array data structure. And talked about
Collection ADT.

* This lab introduces **Linked Lists** Data Structure
* Also, Algorithm analysis. But 61a covers more.

# Linked Lists

* Linked lists are data structures.
* It's not just ADT's that can have various implementations, Data
Structures too can have many ways of being implemented.
* Reminds me of **Recursive Lists** of 61a

* It is basically a chain of Nodes that each store one value,
and **one** other value that points to another Node.
* This is unlike *Trees* where there can be links to multiple nodes
from a given node.

## Ingredients of a Linked List
1. Nodes (ListNode)
    * That has attributes:
        * (Object) myFirst
        * (ListNode) myRest

The rest depends on the variant of Linked Lists:
* **Empty List Node** at the end of the chain
* **Sentinel Nodes** at the beginning of the chain

## Methods to practise writing
* ```size```
* ```get```
* ```toString```
* ```equals```

# Timing Code Segments
* Used to time an algorithm

# Counting statements

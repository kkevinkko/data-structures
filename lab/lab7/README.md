# Inheritance
## Why inheritance?
* Inheritance is a lot more than just preventing you from
copy and pasting code, and then editing to suit your needs *today*.
* It's the powerful idea that, if you do have to make changes
to your children objects *in the future*, you only need to change the
parent class then all children will automatically inherit the new change.
* And all you had to do is formally define the relationship
between classes at the start!
* And it makes making new objects a lot easier, just write the delta
methods or instance variables that differs.

##Stacks and Queues
A stack data structure models a stack of papers, or plates in a restaurant, or boxes in a garage or closet. A new item is placed on the top of the stack, and only the top item on the stack can be accessed at any particular time. Stack operations include the following:
+ *push*ing an item onto the stack;
+ accessing (*peak*) the top item on the stack;
+ *pop*ping the top item off the stack;
+ checking if the stack *is empty*.
